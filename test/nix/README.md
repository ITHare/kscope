To test your version of Clang or GCC, run randomtest.sh (optionally, you MAY export CXX=compiler-you-want-to-test 
before running randomtest.sh, default is g++)

Currently supported platforms are Linux and Mac OS X (adding other platforms should be possible by patching *.sh 
and/or ../randomtestgen.cpp). BTW, such patches to support other platforms are **very** welcome.
